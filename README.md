# homebus-wunderground

Publish Weather Underground data over Homebus.

*This repo is now archived. If Wunderground makes it easy for 3rd parties to access their API again, we'll consider unarchiving it.
As it stands it is severely out of date relative to Homebus and Wunderground has made their previously very useful API very difficult
to gain access to, so we are no longer putting any effort into working with them.*
